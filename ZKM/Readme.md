# ZKM Workshop Task Form

**1. Define universal settlement?**

The process of finalisation of txns unified across all blockchain ecosystems independant of what blockchain they were executed on

**2. Why is Universal Settlement important and how is ZKM achieving this?**

ZKM is using entangled rollups to acheive this. It's important as a guarantee that the txn can't be reverted.

**3. What is an Entangled Rollup? Describe its capabilities**

It's a way to pass messages from one chain to another using zk. It can pass any form of message across chains that are incompatable for eg. so can withdraw and transfer funds from one chain to another in the same rollup network even if they're on incompatable chains. 

**4. How Does the Analogy of Quantum Entanglement Relate to ZKM's Quantum Network?**

The analogy of Quantum Entanglement relates to ZKM's Quantum Network through the concept of equivalent characteristics being maintained regardless of separation. In Quantum Entanglement, subatomic particles exhibit correlated behavior regardless of the distance between them. Similarly, in ZKM's Quantum Network, messages maintain their equivalence and connection regardless of their placement on different blockchains.

**5. Elaborate on the Advantages that ZKM's Quantum Network offers**

- **Trustlessness**: ZKM's Quantum Network operates without reliance on external third-party validators, for example, doesnt need to rely on bridging for cross chain txns.
- **Interoperability**:  Interoperability between different blockchain networks. Can connect to both evm and non evm. 
- **Generalizability**: Generalisable design, so not restricted.
- **Liquidity Optimization**: The network facilitates unified native liquidity across all Layer 2 solutions, optimizing liquidity management within the blockchain ecosystem.

**6. Submit your ZKM use case on Discord under f3-usecases**

Due to the interoperability and universal settlement of ZKM It could be helpful for freelancers or the self employed who recieve payments for their work in different cryptocurrencies and/or on different chains to make getting paid more convinient and to streamline payment processing.
Instead of having payments all over the place, on all the different chains and wallets that you cant remember the private keys for, a financial management platform using zkm could unify payments, to make it easier and more efficient for the person to manage their finances.
Also, it would have the added benefit of privacy and keeping their finanicial transactions with clients confidential due to the nature of zk.
Payments would probably be faster, as would processing times and transaction fees could be lower.
